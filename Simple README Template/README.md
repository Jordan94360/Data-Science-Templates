## 1.Description

A no frills simple README template that can be used for projects or software. Created specifically for people who are new to programming and would like to create professional looking documentation for their projects. 



<br/>

### Background:
Being new to programming and creating projects I found it hard to find a simple template for README files to use, so I created one myself. I wanted to make sure my all my project's READMEs had a consistant format and were simple enough that they could be used for a wide range of projects or programs.

## 2. Usage

Any lines of text that are surrounded by brackets [] are meant to be replaced. Included within the brackets is a short description of what type of information to include in that section and a few examples.
